# Phone_Store
> C++
## Object-Oriented Programming Project
📌 This is an application for managing phones and tablets.

📌 The user can add new phones and tablets, delete existing items, modify phones or tablets, and display lists of phones or tablets.

## *Implementation*✨
- Regarding implementation, the MeniuInteractiv class contains multiple STL containers for storing different types of phones and tablets, such as vectors, sets, lists, and maps. The class uses templates to store information about phones and tablets, so it can store objects of any type. It also uses a singleton instance to ensure that there is always only one instance of the MeniuInteractiv class.

## *Functionality* 👨‍💻
- In terms of functionality, the menu allows the user to add new phones and tablets, prompting them to enter information about each device (such as the release year and price). The user can also delete or modify existing phones or tablets and display lists of phones or tablets. To help the user select the desired option, the menu displays a numbered list of options.
